## Outcomes:

* Published and peer reviewed paper in 23rd Annual CCSC Midwest Conference
* Won second place at CCSC Midwest Conference Student Showcase
* Increased usage of documentation for MyroC library
* Rates of students who come from minority demographics (for tech) increased in the CS department


## Description: 

The bulk of my research for Henry Walker consisted of improving the C based CSC 161 course in the intro sequence (Data Structures and Imperative Programming) for the computer science major at Grinnell College.

As a four person research team, we conducted our research and development work to meet the following goals:

* To increase access and diversity in the Grinnell College computer science department by making the intro sequence easily accessible to minorities in the field
* Expand existing documentation for the MyroC Bluetooth Library for Scribbler robots
* Reveal benefits in the student development team through collaboration

## Work Conducted:

* Tested all existing MyroC Bluetooth library functions as well as new methods that were added
* Wrote new documentation to supplement existing docs
* Created a doc to support porting MyroC Bluetooth library from Linux to MacOS
