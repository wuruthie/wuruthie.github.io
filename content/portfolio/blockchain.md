## Description:

The major soup company hoped to be an early adopter of data focused technology, in particular blockchain for its promising use cases around traceability, transparency, and trust.

The hypothesis of the proof of concept was that my client could instantaneously check the authenticity and provenance of Antibiotic Free Chicken (ABF) in their soup products from their entire ABF chicken supply from egg to processed meat.

## Deliverable:

The design of a proof of concept cloud based platform for every agent in the supply chain to log the status of their ABF chickens. To pair with this platform, I also designed a mobile app for consumers to scan a barcode and learn where the chicken in the can of soup they're holding came from.

## Cloud Platform Design:

> Design of dashboard for farmers to view analytics and stats about their ABF Chickens (Percentage of Chickens that are ABF, average weight etc). In addition to data visualizations, farmers can view the status of every batch they own and view where in the supply chain it came from.

> On this modal (I know, I hate modals too), farmers can "promote" a batch to the next step in the blockchain

## Mobile Device Design

> When a user scans a can of soup, they can see the nutritional info for that soup, as well as allergen information

> As they scroll down, they can view a map with tappable links to separate pags about each step in the supply chain. Additionally, there's coupons for existing local deals for the can of soup that they're holding.

![Supply Chain Map][5]

> Finally, when the user taps on a specific step in the supply chain, they're taken to an informational page about the specific backstory to the hatcher/breeder/farmer they've selected
