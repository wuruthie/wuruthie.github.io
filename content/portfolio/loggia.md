![A journey map for Loggia][1]

## Description: 

When I studied abroad in Budapest in the AIT CS program, I had the opportunity to take a UI + UX design course with Prezi Senior designers. In that class I had the experience of going through an entire design cycle, from brainstorming ideas to building prototypes (Both high and low fidelity) with Balsamiq and InVision.

In this design cycle I...

* Hosted a brainstorming session to create potential apps to solve problems that study abroad students would face
* Created pragmatic personas to bring potential users to life
* Wrote design principles for our UI and UX designs
* Conducted research and review of our top competitor app (Eventbrite) of their heuristics and platform guideline related details
* Drew up mockups and sketches of our app
* Made prototypes using Balsamiq and InVision, and plain old pencil and paper!
* Conducted user research using our mockups (Remote and in person)
* Presented our final designs to Prezi senior designers


## Examples of final Sketch wireframes:

> A wireframe of the app when a user clicks on an event. Events are sorted by tags, and the user has the option to opt in

![Wireframe 1][2] 

> User generated content: a user can upload pictures to promote their event and provide a time, date, description, title, and tags.

![Wireframe 2][3]
