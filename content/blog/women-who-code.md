##Initial Thoughts

![WWCODE CONNECT 2018][1]

* I would first like to thank my friend [Frances Coronel](https://fvcproductions.com/) for inviting me as her speaker guest. I wouldn't have been able to attend if it weren't for Frances giving me her extra ticket.
* The community for women in tech is so small! I ended up running into other women I had connected with at other tech inclusivity events, such as the node.js meetup that npm hosts and friends of other women engineers who were alread in my network. The sisterhood is real.

##Rose:

###Candi: Play the Game
![Candi Castleberry Singleton (VP of ICD at Twitter)][3]
**Candi Castleberry Singleton** (VP of ICD at Twitter) gave an absolutely uplifting and energetic talk which centered around the allegory of corporate culture and card games. The main gist of her message was that whether you want to play into the politics that occur at work or not, there are decisions being made about you (Whether positive or negative) and critical coversations that are being had all the time.

####'Repeat after me! I AM A CARD'

Each employee at a company is represented by a card, and the higher ups will make decisions about who to include (Or exclude) into critical conversations or projects based on what is written on that card. Candi stressed the importance of taking control over what is being *said* about you, or what people *think* about you by being intentional about the story you tell when introducing yourself and through casual conversation.

###Leslie Pajuelo: Node & Microservices at Scale, the Walmart Labs Black Friday Experience
**Leslie Pajuelo** (Software Engineer at Walmart Labs) gave a talk that stood out to me both hilarious and informative. She regaled us with tales from behind the front lines, about how a team of two engineers (Which apparently still hasn't grown much to date) almost singlehandedly made critical improvements to Walmart's ecommerce site to keep it afloat during Black Friday over the course of three years. It was really interesting to me (As someone who is highly interested in performance engineering) to hear about how they struck a balance between reducing the number of service calls and simply shelling out more money for boxes.

Beyond improving performance, I really appreciated @NAME's advice on keeping sprints lean, and learning to say no to the inevitable flood of added on feature requests. @Name made the whole room cackle with the following tips:

* Say yes, and mention that another team will handle it
* Say yes, and push it to another sprint
* Say yes, but don't mention it and see whether it's important enough for people to continue to pester you about it

...etc.

###Frances Coronel: TypeScript 101

![TypeScript 101][5]

[Frances Coronel](https://fvcproductions.com/) gave a completely true to character talk stuffed with cute GIFs of women POC, emojis, and classroom themed slides. As someone who has been screwed over time and time again by Javascript's lack of typing (Thus safety), I appreciated a talk that focused on the growing adoption of TypeScript by companies across the industry. Also, I loved the shout out to opensource with the thorough overview of how TypeScript has made its presence known in repositories across Github! I might be biased because I know firsthand of how much time and effort Frances put into this, but overall I thought it was a presentation that was both fun and educational.

###Norah Klintberg Sakal & Madeleine Shang: Machine Learning and AI
**Norah Klintberg Sakal** and **Madeleine Shang** both gave presentations that made me excited to explore TensorFlow and applications of machine learning. Madeleine gave one of the quickest and comprehensive presentations on ML I've attended, where we went on a whirlwind tour of linear algebra, 3D modeling, and live coded a TensorFlow model to distinguish numbers from handwriting. Norah's focused on how to build models to distinguish between lip shapes. She described how she manually cropped lips from a celebrity image dataset to train her model to distinguish between four distinct types. Norah and Madeleine made machine learning and AI seem accessible to me, and I was amazed at how much information they fit into a 20-30 minute presentation.
